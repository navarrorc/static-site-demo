# Static Site Demo

- In the terminal/command-line run:

  `npm i`

- After the dependencies have been installed, run:

  `npm start`

Have a look at the **package.json** file and at its scripts section to see how npm scripts can be written to execute multiple commands.

### This technical demo shows how the [11ty static site generator](https://11ty.io) can be used to prefetch data from an Api and use it in the index.html, review the **books.js** script in the **\_data** directory.
